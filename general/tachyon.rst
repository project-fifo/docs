Tachyon
#######

Tachyon is a monitoring system for SmartOS (and in theory other Illumos/Solaris derivates) build to monitor large server farms and deal with the amount of data generated there. It does integrate with FiFo, however it is perfectly capable of running on it's own.

Features
--------

* Minimal impact by using kstat directly.
* Resillient to network or component failure.
* Low and predictable space usage ~12bit / metric / second.
* Fast query times (1 or 2 digest milliseconds).
* High throughput and near linear scaling.
* No modification of NGZ's required, new zones will automatically be picked up.

Architecture
------------

.. image:: /_static/images/tachyon.png

Tachyon has a multi layered architecture that balanaces data correctness and availability. The general premise it works under is that over all availability is at a greater importance then absolute correctness. Aside of tachyon itself two aditional components form the stack:

* The `nsq <https://nsq.io>`_ message queue, it is used to allow buffering messages in the case of outages, while buffered messages will not be visible in the database they state can later be completed.
* The `DalmatinerDB <https://dalmatiner.io>`_ database, to handle the throughput and storage requirements.
* The `Grafana <http://grafana.org>`_ dashboard, to visualize the metrics and create dashboards. (plugin required!)

At the lowest level the tachyon-meter, a slightly modified kstat, gathers statistics directly from the kernel and sends them to a nsqd process. kstat is a wonderful tool for that we easily can collect hundreds if not thousands of metrics from a system with virtually no (or minimal) impact to the system. Timestamps are generated locally (at send time) so a delayed delivery does not affect the precision, and it easiely can be correlated by other metrics generated on the system.

The Tachyon Aggregator is the second station metrics take, it decodes the kstat package and translates it into a insert statement that DalmatinerDB can understand. Those services are stateless and if the connection to DalmertinerDB is interrupted they will requeue packages to NSQ for later processing.

The data is persisted in DalmatinerDB and from there can be queried by FiFo the DalmatinerDB Frontend or Grafana.


Installation
------------


Tachyon Meter
`````````````
The tachyon meter can be downloaded from http://release.project-fifo.net/chunter/dev/ and installed the same way as chunter. Ther is a config file in which the IP of the nsqd process has to be specified.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /opt
   curl -O http://release.project-fifo.net/chunter/dev/tachyon-meter-latest.gz
   gunzip tachyon-meter-latest.gz
   sh tachyon-meter-latest

NSQ
```

Installing NSQ in a zone is rather simple, Project-FiFo provides a SmartOS package that can be installed with the following command. The package includes all nsq components, the nsqd queue as well as the admin interface and the nsqadmind, all of them can be configured over the SMF configuration parameters.

.. code-block:: bash

   pkg_add http://release.project-fifo.net/pkg/rel/nsq
 
Another option is to install the nsqd in the GZ however that comes wiht it's own issues and at this point is not recommended.


Tachyon Aggregator
``````````````````

.. note::
   currently only in the dev repository.

The aggregator can be installed out of the Project FiFo package repository, either via ``pkg_add`` or via pkgin install if the repository was added to the dependencies. The package name is tahcyon-aggregator


DalmatinerDB
````````````

Please follow the `official guide <https://docs.dalmatiner.io>`_.


Grafana
```````

There is currently no SmartOS package for Grafana2, it requires manual compilation, you can follow the installation guide. Since DalmatinerDB does not ship as a native datasource we maintain a `fork <https://github.com/dalmatinerdb/grafana>`_.

Once installed you can add DalmatinerDB to the dependencies, the default port of the Dalmatiner Frontend server is 8080.

For the time being, a precompiled binary of grafana with our changes can be downloaded `here <http://release.project-fifo.net/chunter/rel/grafana-2.0.2.tgz>`_.

Configuration
-------------

Tachyon Meter
`````````````

The file ``/opt/tachyon-meter/etc/tachyon.conf`` needs to be edited:

.. code-block:: bash

   # The NSQd host to send data to
   host=192.168.1.41 # Needs to be changed to the IP of the zone hosting the NSQd daemon

   # The port NSQd listens to HTTP messages
   port=4151 # Does not need to be changed

   # Tne NSQ topic to send to
   topic=tachyon # Does not need to be changed

   # The interval to send data to NSQ to in seconds
   interval=1 # does not need to be changed

   # The hostname to identify the server with
   ## Will try to pick up chunters host_id file if existing otherwise
   ## simply use the hostname.
   if [ -f /opt/chunter/etc/host_id ]
   then
     hostname="$(cat /opt/chunter/etc/host_id)"
   else
     hostname="$(hostname)"
   fi

   is_smf=yes # Does not need to be changed, required for backgrouding in the SMF

Tachyon Aggregator
``````````````````

The file ``/opt/local/tachyon/etc/tachyon.conf`` needs to be edited, most options are explained
in the file, the two most important ones are the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   ## The DalmatinerDB backend (if used).
   ##
   ## Default: 127.0.0.1:5555
   ##
   ## Acceptable values:
   ##   - an IP/port pair, e.g. 127.0.0.1:10011
   ddb = 192.168.1.42:5555 # Needs to be changed to point to one dalmatinerdb host

   ## One more more nsqlookupd http interfaces for tachyon to discover
   ## the channels.
   ##
   ## Default: 127.0.0.1:4161
   ##
   ## Acceptable values:
   ##   - an IP/port pair, e.g. 127.0.0.1:10011
   nsqlookupd.name = 127.0.0.1:4161 # Neds to be pointed to a nsq lookup deamon,
                                    # more then one of this can be used with
                                    # different names


NSQ
```

The NSQ config is done via the SMF configuration interface changing the configuration works like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   svccfg -s svc:/network/nsqd:default
   svc:/network/nsqd:default> addpg application application
   svc:/network/nsqd:default> setprop application/lookupd-tcp-address="127.0.0.1:4160"
   svc:/network/nsqd:default> refresh


The same applies for nsqadmin and nsqlookupd instances. The available configuration parameters can be
read via: ``svccfg export nsqd | grep propval``.

DalmatinerDB
````````````

Please follow the `official guide <https://docs.dalmatiner.io>`_.

Grafana
```````

It mostly configured over the web interface, oterhwise see the offical documentation.
