Configuration
*************

The Jingles configuration file is stored in 
``/opt/local/fifo-jingles/dist/scripts/config.js``. 
It's a JSON file with configuration values. It is copied during the first installation and cannot be overwritten, however the newest configuration can always be found under ``/opt/local/fifo-jingles/dist/scripts/config.js.example``. 
In this config file you can set the remote dataset server source and thresholds for dashboard alerts and timeout values. 

.. note::
	Please see the inline comments within the file on how to make setting changes.
